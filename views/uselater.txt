      <h4 class = 'text-lg text-right py-8 p-8'>CYKE exists to close the gap that has always existed within recycling: not everyone has the means to participate even if they want to</h4>

      <h3 class = 'text-lg text-right py-8 p-8'>You can use CYKE to build up your recycling progress, keep track of those gains, and get paid for it.</h3>
      </br>
    
      <h3 class = 'text-lg text-right p-8'>You can then use your compensation to satisfy needs of underserved communities around you or any needs you may have yourself. </h3>
